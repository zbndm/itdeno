# üç£ Itsudeno

*Itsudeno* is a scriptable IT automation system written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and running on [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno).
It can be used to easily deploy and configure applications, services and networks on target hosts.

### üçô Using YAML

```yml
- _: Set file content
  file.content:
    path: /tmp/itsudeno.example
    content: Hello! Current time is ${new Date()}

- _: Configure firewalls
  loop:chain: [ INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD ]
  net.firewall:
    chain: ${chain}
    policy: DROP

- _: Install packages
  packages.apt:
    name: net-tools
    state: latest
```

### üçò Using TypeScript

```ts
import * as it from "https://deno.land/x/itsudeno";

await it.tasks(({_, vault, tools}) => {
  for (const user of ["foo", "bar", "baz"]) {
    await _(`Create users and save passwords into default vault`)
      .os.user({
        user,
        password: await vault.get(`${user}_password`, await tools.mkpasswd())
      });
  }

  await _("Wait for user input")
    .wait.user({
      message: "Itsudeno successfully configured your machine, ready?",
      type: "confirm",
    });
});

```
